This project integrates **Arduino UNO** with multiple sensors and a machine learning layer to proactively monitor and predict crop health, aiming to prevent crop failure. By leveraging environmental data and intelligent classification, it provides actionable insights to farmers and stakeholders, ensuring timely interventions and sustainable agriculture practices.  



## üåü **Mission**  
To **empower farmers** and stakeholders by providing early warnings of potential crop failure, enabling preventive measures through real-time environmental monitoring and machine learning predictions.



## üîß **How It Works**  

### **1. Sensor Network and Arduino Setup**  
- The **Arduino UNO** serves as the central hub, connected to an array of sensors:  
  - **Soil Moisture Sensor**: Measures soil hydration levels.  
  - **Photoelectric Diode Sensor**: Monitors light intensity.  
  - **Humidity Sensor**: Captures atmospheric humidity.  
- These sensors periodically collect environmental data.  

### **2. Machine Learning Layer**  
A **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm forms the backbone of the prediction system, processing data to identify potential risks.  



## üõ†Ô∏è **Phases of Operation**  

### **A. Training Phase**  
1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Environmental parameters are captured through the sensor network.  
   - Raw data undergoes **preprocessing** to ensure quality.  
2. **Model Training**:  
   - Cleaned data is fed to the ML classifier.  
   - Data is clustered into predefined classes:  
     - **Dry**  
     - **Excess Heat**  
     - **Healthy**  
     - **Unfavorable**  
   - The trained model serves as a baseline for future predictions.  

### **B. Testing Phase**  
1. **Real-Time Data Testing**:  
   - Live environmental data is collected by sensors and fed into the trained classifier.  
2. **Classification and Prediction**:  
   - The ML model evaluates parametric features and classifies data into the same categories:  
     - **Dry**, **Excess Heat**, **Healthy**, or **Unfavorable**.  
3. **Actionable Insights**:  
   - The system identifies the **most probable cause** of degradation.  
   - Through an intuitive **User Interface (UI)**, stakeholders receive recommendations on necessary preventive steps.
